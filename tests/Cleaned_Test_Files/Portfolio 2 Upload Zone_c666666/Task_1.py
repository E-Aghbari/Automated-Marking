# Task 1 [7 points out of 30] My first not-so-pretty image classifier
# Your first task is to implement the kNN classifier on your own. The template contains a range of functions
# you must implement and use appropriately for this task. The template also uses a range of functions implemented
# by the module leader to support you in this task, particularly relating to reading images and csv files accompanying
# this portfolio.
# You can start working on this task immediately. Please consult at the very least Week 2 materials.
